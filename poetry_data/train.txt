Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet,
And so are you.

The road not taken,
Two paths diverged in a wood,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Hope is the thing with feathers,
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all.

I wandered lonely as a cloud,
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils.
