Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet,
And so are you.

The Road Not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth.

Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all.
